# Traffic Jam Busters
## Transportation and Traffic Congestion Analysis

What are the main causes of traffic congestion? Can we predict traffic congestion?

### Objective
To analyze traffic congestion patterns in a specific city and identify factors contributing to congestion. Additionally, to develop predictive models for traffic congestion based on historical data.
### Project Plan
#### Problem Definition and Data Collection
* Define the scope of the project, including the target city or area.
* Identify data sources:
	* Traffic data: Real-time traffic data from transportation authorities or APIs (e.g., Google Maps API, HERE API).
	* Weather data: Historical weather data from sources like NOAA or weather APIs.
 	* Event data: Information on accidents, road closures, and special events affecting traffic.
	* Road infrastructure data: Road network maps and information about traffic signals.
	* Historical traffic data: Historical traffic flow data for model training.
  
#### Data Collection and Preprocessing
* Gather data from the identified sources, including API integration where applicable.
* Clean and preprocess the data:
	* Handle missing values.
	* Standardize formats and units (e.g., time zones, measurement units).
	* Merge and aggregate data from different sources into a unified dataset.
	* Perform exploratory data analysis to understand data distributions and patterns.

#### Feature Engineering
* Create relevant features for analysis and modeling:
* Time-based features (e.g., time of day, day of week, holidays).
* Weather-related features (e.g., temperature, precipitation).
* Road-specific features (e.g., road type, number of lanes).
* Event-related features (e.g., accident occurrence).

#### Data Analysis
* Visualize traffic congestion patterns over time.
* Explore correlations between traffic congestion and factors like weather, events, and road characteristics.
* Conduct statistical analyses to identify significant contributors to congestion.

#### Predictive Modeling
* Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
* Develop machine learning models to predict traffic congestion levels.
* Experiment with various algorithms (e.g., regression, time series forecasting, neural networks).
* Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).

#### Interpretation and Insights
* Interpret model results to understand which factors are most influential in predicting traffic congestion.
* Provide recommendations for congestion mitigation based on findings.

#### Documentation and Reporting
C* reate a comprehensive report summarizing the project, methodology, and results.
* Include visualizations and insights.
* Share the code and documentation on platforms like GitHub.

#### Presentation and Communication
* Prepare a presentation to communicate findings and recommendations to stakeholders.
* Future Work
* Discuss potential extensions or improvements to the project, such as real-time congestion prediction or integration with traffic management systems.

#### Final Portfolio Inclusion
* Document the entire project, including code, datasets, reports, and presentations, in your data science portfolio.

### Possible Data Sources
* Real-time Traffic Data API (e.g., Google Maps Traffic API)
* Weather Data API (e.g., NOAA API)
* Government Traffic Data Portals
* Local Transportation Authorities
* Event Data from News Sources or Event APIs
* Road Network Data Providers
